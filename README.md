## 👋 Hi, I’m @lwu877
[![spotify-github-profile](https://spotify-github-profile.kittinanx.com/api/view?uid=q0ct9gnvb3ji1vmcf2oevqkr2&cover_image=true&theme=novatorem&show_offline=true&background_color=000000&interchange=false&bar_color=53b14f&bar_color_cover=true)](https://spotify-github-profile.kittinanx.com/api/view?uid=q0ct9gnvb3ji1vmcf2oevqkr2&redirect=true)

The most average musician/coder/journalist you've ever seen.

- 👀 I’m trying new things all the time - it's just that sometimes, my existing stuff takes priority
- I work primarily with front-end stuff - think websites, widgets, and little toys
- Currently studying journalism at Stony Brook University

### My Current Projects
- Music work (at [lwumusic.com](https://lwumusic.com))
  - Time releases November 24th
  - The [] and the [] releases December 18th
- The Murder at Evansmith Manor (a musical two years in the making - currently rewriting)
- Clark Coates and the Suspicious Slate (a little game project - currently writing)
- More stuff that I'd love to talk about, just haven't done enough to warrant talking about
