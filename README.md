## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lwu877

I'm a musician that does too much stuff.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m trying new things all the time - it's just that sometimes, my existing stuff takes priority
- I'm well-versed in writing documentation and making pretty little interfaces. Coding, on the other hand? Maybe not...
-  ðŸ“« How to reach me: [email me](mailto:lex@lexwu.com)
