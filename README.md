## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lwu877

I'm a musician that does too much stuff.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m trying new things all the time - it's just that sometimes, my existing stuff takes priority
- I work primarily with front-end stuff - think websites, widgets, and little toys.
-  ðŸ“« How to reach me: [email me](mailto:lex@lexwu.com)
